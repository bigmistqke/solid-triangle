!!WIP!!

ðŸ”º a threejs-renderer for solidjs ðŸ”º
ðŸ”¥ by [@solid-primitives/jsxParser](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-primitives/pull/276) ðŸ”¥

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i solid-triangle
# or
yarn add solid-triangle
# or
pnpm add solid-triangle
```

Use it:

```tsx
import {Canvas, Scene, Camera, Mesh, Material, Geometry} from 'solid-triangle'

// simple example
const [rotation, setRotation] = createSignal(0);
setInterval(() => setRotation(r => r + 0.01), 1000 / 60)

const App => (
  <Canvas>
    <Controls.Orbit active>
    <Camera.Perspective
      position={{x: -5, y: 0, z: 0}}
      active
    >
    <Scene active>
      <Mesh radius={{x: 0, y: 0, z: rotation()}}>
        <Geometry.Sphere radius={0.5}>
        <Material.Mesh.Basic color={new THREE.Color('red')}>
      </Mesh>
    </Scene>
  </Canvas>
)```

```tsx
import {Canvas, Scene, Camera, Mesh, Material, Geometry} from 'solid-triangle'

// multiple scenes
const [rotation, setRotation] = createSignal(0);
const [activeSceneName, setActiveSceneName] = createSignal("first");
const activeScene = createSelector(activeSceneName);

const App => (
  <Canvas>
    <Controls.Orbit active>
    <Camera.Perspective active>
    <Scene active={activeScene("first")}>
      <Mesh radius={{x: 0, y: 0, z: rotation()}}>
        <Geometry.Sphere radius={0.5}>
        <Material.Mesh.Basic color={new THREE.Color('red')}>
      </Mesh>
    </Scene>
    <Scene active={activeScene("second")}>
     <Mesh radius={{x: 0, y: 0, z: rotation()}}>
       <Geometry.Sphere radius={0.5}>
       <Material.Mesh.Basic color={new THREE.Color('red')}>
     </Mesh>
    </Scene>
  </Canvas>
)
```

```tsx
import {Canvas, Scene, Camera, Mesh, Material, Geometry, Selector} from 'solid-triangle'

// multiple scenes using Selector
const [rotation, setRotation] = createSignal(0);
const [activeSceneName, setActiveSceneName] = createSignal("first");
const activeScene = createSelector(activeSceneName);

const App => (
  <Canvas>
    <Controls.Orbit active>
    <Camera.Perspective active>
    <Selector.Scene id="first">
      <Scene id="first">
        <Mesh radius={{x: 0, y: 0, z: rotation()}}>
          <Geometry.Sphere radius={0.5}>
          <Material.Mesh.Basic color={new THREE.Color('red')}>
        </Mesh>
      </Scene>
      <Scene id="second">
       <Mesh radius={{x: 0, y: 0, z: rotation()}}>
         <Geometry.Sphere radius={0.5}>
         <Material.Mesh.Basic color={new THREE.Color('red')}>
       </Mesh>
      </Scene>
    </Selector>
  </Canvas>
)
```
